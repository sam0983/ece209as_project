# Abstract

AIoT (Artiﬁcial Intelligence of Things) is a relatively newterm that has recently become a hot topic that combinestwo of the hottest acronyms, AI (Artiﬁcial Intelligence) andIoT (Internet of Things). IoT consists of interconnectedthings with built-in sensors and has the potential to generateor collect a vast amount of data. Individual IoT systems canbe integrated into a large-scale system for various modernapplications. With that comes a lot of collected or real-timedata, an intelligent and eﬃcient data processing is essentialto make eﬀective use of the information generated from thesedata. The data can be analyzed and utilized with AI forproblem-solving or decision-making. Without AI, IoT wouldhave limited value. AI can multiply the value of IoT; con-versely, IoT can promote the learning and intelligence ofAI. However, there are many challenges while deployingAIoT in practice. For instance, machine learning is one ofthe key technologies to be utilized in AIoT systems. Besides,there are many other issues such as complexity, eﬃciency,scalability, accuracy, and robustness related to the increasingmodern AIoT systems and applications
